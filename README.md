# Alarmdar
Alarms and reminders, packaged into one app!

A reminder is shown when an alarm rings, 
which then plays a loud ringtone and vibrates continuously.
A sticky notification would also appear.

## Features
- Repeating alarms with intervals
- Ability to snooze an alarm for 10 minutes
- Copying a reminder to clipboard
- Gesture shortcuts for editing (long tap) and deleting (swipe) alarms
- Dashboard is sorted by upcoming alarms
- Add a location searchbar (*to be implemented*)
- Sync alarms to a device's calendar (*to be determined*)

## Acknowledgements

## Why aren't my alarms ringing?
*NOTE: These instructions may differ between devices.*

You need to turn off to battery optimizations for this app.
Open Settings, and go to `Apps → Alarmdar`.

**If a notification does not appear:**
Turn off battery optimizations for this app.
Go to `Battery → Battery Optimization`.
From the list of apps, find `Alarmdar` and select `Don't optimize`.
Reschedule the alarm.

**If a sound is not playing:**
First check the ringer's volume and mode.
If it is not muted, go to `Notifications` and select `Reminder Alarms`.
Here, toggle the sound mode to `Silent` and then back to `Alert`.
Reschedule the alarm.
